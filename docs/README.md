# 2D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation

This repository contains the code necessary to compute the 2D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and plot some of his chaotic solutions.

### Running the code

First download the code from the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:victorballester7/2d-kuramoto-sivashinsky.git
cd 2d-kuramoto-sivashinsky
```

Then, you can run the code by typing:

```
./run.sh
```

Be aware of the input parameters that you pass to the code. You can edit them from the file `data/input.txt`, and more information about the fields in there can be found `docs/input_README.txt`.

### Animations

You will find some animations of the solutions in the `latex/presentation/videos` folder.
